Curling Results Analysis
========================

Looking at curling box scores available from the World Curling Federation's
[Results and Statistics](results.worldcurling.org) website.

Currently, I am waiting to hear back about the RESTful access to the website, so
for now I am using `requests` and `bs4` (beautiful soup) to pull game data. This
is also my first real use of these two libraries, so there will be a lot of
learning going into it.
