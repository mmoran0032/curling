wcf.py -- World Curling Federation Data Wrangler
================================================

*Note: this package is not officially endorsed or supported by the WCF*

Pull tournament and game data from the
`World Curling Federation's <http://worldcurling.org/>`__
`results site <http://results.worldcurling.org>`__, using ``requests`` and
``bs4`` (BeautifulSoup4). Requires an active and stable internet connection.

This package was originally created to supplement my needs of pulling the data
while I was waiting for official API access.
